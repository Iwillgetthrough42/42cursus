----------|---------
|1. Libft |This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.|
|2. Get_next_line | May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.
|3. ft_printf | This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.
|4. ft_server | This is a System Administration subject. You will discover Docker and youwill set up your first web server.
|5. minitalk | The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program usingUNIX signals.
|7.push_swap | This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, usingthe lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate varioustypes of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for anoptimized data sorting.
|8.philosophers |  In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You willlearn how to make threads. You will discover the mutex.
|9.minishell | The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, yourlittle bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.
|10.netpractice | NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.
|11.cppmodules(0-8)| Classes in c++
|12.Inception | This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.
|Webserv | This project is about writing your ow HTTP server. You will be able to test it with an actual browser. HTTP is one of the most used protocols on the internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won’t be working on a website.
|Ft_transcendence | integrate Pong game in a website using Javascript React.js and nest
