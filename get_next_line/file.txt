TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data.
Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in-order at the receiver.
Consider the first solution as TCP. A connection has to made ( bridge ) to get the data (letter) delivered.
Th data is reliable because it will directly reach to another end without loss in data or error.
And the second solution is UDP. No connection is required for sending the data.
The process is fast as compare to TCP, where we need to set up connection(bridge). But the data is not reliable: we don’t know whether the pigeon will go in the right direction, or it will drop the letter on the way or some issue is encountered in mid-travel.
